## Example

Cloned from an example project for testing purposes.

## Setup
Quick setup to see the thingy in action. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/emailtoakash/example

Enter the folder and let npm install the required packages:

    cd example
    npm install

Use the Nativescript Playground and Preview apps to preview:

    ./node_modules/.bin/tns preview

That is probably it.
